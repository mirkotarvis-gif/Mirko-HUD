## Notes
- **Zoom** works by temporarily lowering your FOV (the game's minimum is 30) and sensitivity, then restoring them.
  Default key is C. If the game crashes mid-zoom your FOV might stay low; just set it back in Options.
- **Fullbright** gives your client a hidden night vision effect.
- The bundled fonts are under the SIL Open Font License; see `assets/shiftmenu/font/licenses`.

## Building
Requires JDK 21 or newer.

```
./gradlew build        # Windows: gradlew.bat build
```

The jar ends up at `build/libs/mirkos-hud-1.3.0.jar`. Put it in `.minecraft/mods` together with
**Fabric API** for 1.21.11, and launch with **Fabric Loader** for 1.21.11.

No JDK? Push this folder to a GitHub repo: the included workflow builds it automatically, and
the jar shows up under the run's **Artifacts**.
